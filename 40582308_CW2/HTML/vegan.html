<h2> The Department for Agriculture and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) states that:</h2>

<h3>‘Organic food is the product of a farming system which avoids the use of man-made fertilisers, pesticides; growth 
regulators and livestock feed additives. Irradiation and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) 
or products produced from or by GMOs are generally prohibited by organic legislation.
Organic agriculture is a systems approach to production that is working towards environmentally, socially and economically sustainable production.
 Instead, the agricultural systems rely on crop rotation, animal and plant manures, some hand weeding and biological pest control’.</h3>

<h3>Organic agriculture is about a way of farming that pays close attention to nature by using fewer chemicals on the land such as artificial fertilisers, 
which can pollute waterways. It means more wildlife and biodiversity, the absence of veterinary medicines such as antibiotics in rearing livestock and the
 avoidance of genetic modification. Organic farming can also offer benefits for animal welfare, as animals are required to be kept in more natural, free range conditions.</h3>
